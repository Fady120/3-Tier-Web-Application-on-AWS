## Solution Overview ✨

This repository illustrates how to manually provision a **highly available**, **scalable**, and **secure 3‑tier web application** on AWS using the AWS Console or CLI.  
Ideal for hands-on learning, audit transparency, or environments where scripted automation isn’t used.

## Architecture Diagram 🖼️

Below is the high-level architecture deployed across two Availability Zones:

## Components ⚙️

### Networking 🚦
- VPC with two **public** and two **private** subnets  
- **Internet Gateway** for inbound traffic  
- **NAT Gateways** (one per AZ) for private-tier internet access  
  - ⚠️ **Important:** Each **public NAT Gateway** requires an **Elastic IP (EIP)** to function, ensuring a static and routable IP address for outbound internet traffic.
- Custom **Route Tables** ensuring proper routing

### Security 🔒
- Security groups for frontend, backend, and database tiers  
- WAF protection at both edge and application layers  
- IAM roles assigned to EC2 instances for least-privilege operations

### Frontend Tier 🌐
- EC2 instances (running NGINX) in public subnets  
- Auto Scaling Group for dynamic scaling  
- Internet-facing Load Balancer distributes user traffic  
- CloudFront provides caching, edge delivery, and DDoS protection

### Backend Tier ⚙️
- EC2 application/API servers in private subnets  
- Internal Load Balancer manages inter-service traffic  
- Secure and private communication with frontend and database tiers

### Database Tier 🗄️
- Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL/MySQL) in Multi‑AZ private subnets  
- Automated backups, snapshots, and failover functionality  
- Database access restricted only to backend tier

### Monitoring & Logging 📊
- Amazon CloudWatch collects metrics and logs  
- Alarms alert on unhealthy instances or threshold breaches  
- Optional SNS integration for notifications

## Manual Deployment Steps 📋

1. **Network Setup** 🚧  
2. **Security Configuration** 🔐  
3. **Deploy Frontend** 🌐  
4. **Deploy Backend** ⚙️  
5. **Provision Database** 🗄️  
6. **Enable Monitoring** 📈

## Use Cases & Benefits 💡

- Hands-on AWS infrastructure learning  
- Audit-friendly manual provisioning  
- Production-grade template for web/API apps  
- Cost-effective, using AWS free-tier resources

---

## Customization 🔧

- Swap EC2 backend for ECS or EKS  
- Add caching layer with Redis or Memcached  
- Introduce CI/CD pipelines (CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, etc.)  
- Export this setup to CloudFormation  
- Enhance with VPC Flow Logs, advanced dashboards, or X-Ray

## Cleanup 🧹

1. Delete CloudFront distribution  
2. Tear down load balancers (frontend & backend)  
3. Remove EC2 Auto Scaling Groups and templates  
4. Delete RDS instance  
5. Remove NAT Gateways, route tables, and VPC  
6. Clean up CloudWatch logs and alarms
